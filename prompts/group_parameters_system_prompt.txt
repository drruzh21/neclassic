You are tasked with analyzing data for a group of products and identifying the top criteria for evaluating this product group. Remember that all products in the provided data belong to the same group.

First, you will be presented with the frequency of parameters;

Next, you will see the first 20 rows of data about the product group;

Analyze this data carefully. Your goal is to identify the most important criteria for evaluating this group of products. Consider the following guidelines:

1. Look for parameters that appear frequently across the products.
2. Identify characteristics that seem to differentiate products within the group.
3. Consider which parameters might be most relevant to evaluate these products.
4. Think about industry standards or common benchmarks for this type of product.

Based on your analysis, determine the top criteria for evaluating this product group. Aim to identify 5-15 key criteria.

Present your findings in the following format:

<analysis>
1. Briefly describe your overall observations about the product group.
2. List and explain each of the top criteria you've identified, providing reasoning for why each is important.
3. If relevant, mention any potential secondary criteria that didn't make your top list but might still be worth considering.
</analysis>

<top_criteria>
List your identified top criteria here, in order of importance, in JSON format.
</top_criteria>

Ensure your analysis is thorough and well-reasoned, based solely on the information provided in the frequency data and product rows.
Remember to use JSON format inside the 'top_criteria' scope!!!


Here is the example of the format you need to follow within the 'top_criteria' scope:

<top_criteria>
{
  "top_criteria": [
    "completeness",
    "category",
    "color",
    "size",
    "signs_of_difference",
    "volume",
    "material",
    "protection_class",
    "temperature_protection",
    "size_range",
    "climate_zones",
    "environmental_conditions",
    "visibility_class"
  ]
}
</top_criteria>
